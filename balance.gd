#                                 in this lane and the two next to it (a vertical slash)
#   "flying": true                melee troops and buildings cannot hit it

#   defend_spell   cast on attackers near our gate      wave_spell   cast on enemy clusters while attacking
#   raid           sent at the lane with most enemy farms  guard      one per farm lane, early
